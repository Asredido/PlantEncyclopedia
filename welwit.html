      <h2>Basic Info:</h2>
      <p>Welwitschia is named after the Austrian 
        botanist and doctor Friedrich Welwitsch, who described the plant in Angola in 1859. Welwitsch was so overwhelmed by 
        the plant that he, "could do nothing but kneel down and gaze at it.After germination, the seedling produces two cotyledons
        which grow to 25–35 mm (0.98–1.38 in) in length, and have reticulate venation.Subsequently, two foliage leaves are produced at the edge of a woody bilobed crown.
        The permanent leaves are opposite (at right angles to the cotyledons), amphistomatic (producing stomata on both sides of the leaf), parallel-veined and ribbon-shaped.
        Shortly after the appearance of the foliage leaves, the apical meristem dies and meristematic activity is transferred to the periphery of the crown.</p>

      <h2>Location:</h2>
      <p>Welwitschia mirabilis is endemic to the Kaokoveld Desert, which lies within the Namib Desert. The population is distributed southwards from the Bentiaba River in southern Angola, 
        to the Kuiseb River in Namibia, and up to 100 km (62 mi) inland of the coast. The area is extremely arid; 
        the coast is recorded as having almost zero rainfall, while less than 100 mm (3.9 in) of rain falls annually below the escarpment 
        in the wet season from February to April. Populations tend to occur in ephemeral watercourses, indicating a dependence on groundwater in addition to precipitation from fog.</p>

      <h2>Important Info:</h2>
      <p>Welwitschia mirabilis grows readily from seed, which may be bought from specialty seed dealers. The seeds have been shown to display orthodox seed behavior, which in general means 
        that they may be stored for long periods at suitably low humidity and temperature. Welwitschia seeds naturally develop suitably low water concentrations as they ripen.
        The age of individual plants is difficult to assess, but many plants may be over 1,000 years old. 
        Some individuals may be more than 2,000 years old. As the species does not produce yearly rings, plant age is determined by radiocarbon dating.</p>
