    About: This website is all about plants. The links will guide you towards some plants I personally, 
    chose because I felt they were really interesting. Most of these plants were selected by random, but I only researched them and 
    put them in if they were REALLY intersting. All of the plants researched on this website were researched through Wikipedia, and the links to their respective pages
    will be just under the picture by the "BACK" button. Just Click the "Navigation" button to be guided to my list of plants.
