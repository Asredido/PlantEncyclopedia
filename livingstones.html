        λίθος (líthos) 'stone' and ὄψ (óps) 'face', referring to the stone-like appearance of the plants.They avoid being eaten by 
        blending in with surrounding rocks and are often known as pebble plants or living stones.</p>

      <h2>Important Info:</h2>
      <p>Individual Lithops plants consist of one or more pairs of bulbous, almost fused leaves opposite to each other and hardly any stem. 
       The slit between the leaves contains the meristem and produces flowers and new leaves. The leaves of Lithops are mostly 
        buried below the surface of the soil, with a partially or completely translucent top surface known as a leaf window which allows light to 
        enter the interior of the leaves for photosynthesis.</p>
